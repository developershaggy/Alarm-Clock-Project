# Alarm-Clock-Project
This project is an alarm clock web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set alarms and get notified with sound when the specified time is reached.
The tech stack used here is basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Alarm set Can be discarded before and after the set time. The case is also handled when the selected time doesn't have proper input values, there it gives the alert message.
